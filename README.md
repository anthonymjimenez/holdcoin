 We understand the temptation to sell when prices are low. So do all the other coin exchange markets, that's why they make their apps as addictive as possible. They thrive off constant buying and selling with no regard to what happens to you, the investor.   

 We do things a little differently at holdcoin.We want you to buy and sell, but never at the cost of you losing money. We firmly believe in the foundational principle of holding. True crypto believers deserve a market place that reenforces proven strategy  and not spur of the moment decision making. 

 holdcoin isn't a crypto, it's the new way to buy crypto smarter. See how holdcoin can maximize your profits today!
